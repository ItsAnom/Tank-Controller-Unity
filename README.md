# Tank-Controller-Unity
I've been working on this tank controller script for a while now. There has been few issues with it in regards of what I'm trying to get it to work the way I want it to behave.

So the idea is that the player is in 1st person mode and they are able to move inside the tank and interact certain things with the tank. For example getting in the driver set. While being in the driver set the player can only look straight a head and down also move the tank. So what I want is the player to have their rotation locked with the tanks rotation but I can't seem to find a solution for it.
